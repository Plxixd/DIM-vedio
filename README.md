GX 339-4, 4U 1543 -47 disk instability model (DIM) vedio.

The top panel shows surface density, central temperature, and the alpha variable as functions of time.

The bottom panel shows the simulation optical and near-infrared (OIR) light curve, with the red dot representing the current time. The x-axis represents time; its absolute value is not important, only the relative time is significant.
